In the future, the integration of blockchain technology and distributed photovoltaic energy will probably break the existing pattern of concentrated energy production and transmission and distribution, and it is expected to subvert the traditional business models and profit models of energy companies. This is a suggestion made at the Davos Forum in summer 2017.

With the rapid development of the age of science and technology, human beings have used the non-renewable resources of nature gifts in exchange for technological products, and fewer and fewer resources are available to us and future generations. Conversely, sacrificing environmental protection brings about a global increase in the global greenhouse effect, which has been working since the formation of the Earth's greenhouse effect. If there is no greenhouse effect, the surface of the earth will be extremely cold, and the temperature will drop to minus 20 degrees Celsius. The ocean will freeze and life will not be formed. Therefore, we are not faced with the problem of whether or not there is a greenhouse effect, but human beings are burning fossil fuels to emit a large amount of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing the greenhouse effect and the earth's climate to undergo drastic changes.

When the average temperature in the world rises by 1°C, huge changes will occur: sea levels will rise, mountainous glaciers will recede, and snow-covered areas will shrink. As global temperatures rise, unbalanced rainfall will result, precipitation in some areas will increase, and precipitation in other areas will decrease. For example, the Sahelian region in West Africa has been severely arid since 1965. In North China, the precipitation has decreased year after year since 1965. Compared with the 1950s, precipitation in North China has decreased by 1/3, and water resources have decreased by 1/1. 2; The area affected by drought in China is about 400 million mu each year. In the normal years, the irrigation areas in the country each year have a water shortage of 30 billion cubic meters, and the city lacks 6 billion cubic meters of water. When the average temperature in the world rises by 3°C, humans are no longer able to recover, and the world will be tight. As the temperature rises, global sea level rises at a rate of 1 to 2 millimeters per year over the past 100 years, and it is expected that sea level will continue to rise by 30 to 50 centimeters by 2050, which will inundate large amounts of low-lying land along the coast; in addition, due to the climate Changes have led to an increase in climate disasters such as droughts and floods and low temperatures, resulting in economic losses of about tens of billions of dollars a year in the world.

• Foundations such as the Oak Foundation jointly promote the application and popularization of new types of clean energy photovoltaics, and make a contribution to increasing the use of photovoltaics for more understanding of photovoltaic value for environmental protection. Constant amount of 770 million optoelectronics is issued, and the calculation power increases the mining coefficient according to the power capacity of the photovoltaic power generation unit. It is estimated that the mining can be completed 20 years after mining.

PEC Optoelectronics Chain; The highly innovative “POW+POS” technology has successfully developed a third-generation encrypted digital currency that combines alternative smart contracts, multi-chain parallelism, consensus mechanisms, P2P networking, storage, encryption, and other functional templates. , to achieve the new application of photovoltaic energy value.
